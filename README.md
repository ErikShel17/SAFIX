# SAFIX
SAFIX - **A simple pack to use for your GTA San Andreas before you proceed with installing mods.**

```
My pack is made of mods like CLEO, SkyGFX, MixSets and etc to help prepare your GTA:SA for installing mods. Please note: I am not the creator of those mods. All credits go to the people who created those mods! 
```

List of mods included in this pack (and what they do).
 - [x] _noDEP.asi - Prevents <b>Windows from blocking some functions of your mods by using Data Execution Prevention.</b>  
 - [x] CLEO - Plugin that allows to use cleo mods. (I have no idea why I've explained this because you probably know it lmao)
 - [x] CrashInfo - Shows you logs when your game crashes. This can help to explain what causes your game to crash, f.e some mod/script? 
 - [x] Modloader - Does what it says. It loads mods for you when you put them in <b>modloader folder</b>. It also contains .asi file responsible for it to load. 
 - [x] SkyGFX -  Mod that brings accurate PS2/Xbox graphics to your GTA San Andreas game. It has a config file skygfx.ini where you can edit everything to your liking.

 - [x] WindowedMode - Runs the game in Windowed Borderless. You can delete this from <b>scripts</b> folder if you don't need it. (Delete <b>III.VC.SA.WindowedMode.ini ; III.VC.SA.WindowedMode.asi</b>files and you're good to go.
 - [x] MixSets - Another mod with lots of fixes & tweaks just like <b>SilentPatch</b>.

 Note: All credits go to original mod owners. I'm not owning any of these. I just made this pack so you don't need to manually
 install those mods/or search for them.
